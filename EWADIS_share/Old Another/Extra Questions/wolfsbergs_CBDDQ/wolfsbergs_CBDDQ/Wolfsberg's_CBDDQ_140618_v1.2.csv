"The questionnaire is required to be answered on a Legal Entity (LE) Level. This means the Financial Institution will answer the questionnaire at an ultimate parent / head office & subsidiary level for which any branches would be considered covered by that parent/subsidiary DDQ.  This questionnaire should not cover more than one LE.   Each question in the DDQ will need to be addressed from the perspective of the LE and on behalf of all of its branches.  If a response for the LE differed for one of its branches this needs to be highlighted and detail regarding this difference captured at the end of each subsection. If a branch business activity (products offered, client base etc.) is significantly different than its head office, the branch should complete a separate questionnaire.",,
